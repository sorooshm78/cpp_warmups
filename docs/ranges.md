### **Ranges in C++ (from C++20)**

**Ranges** are a modern way in C++20 to work with collections of data more expressively and safely. The idea is to **work directly with sequences of elements** (like containers, arrays, views) **without dealing manually with iterators**.

---

## 🔧 **Why Use Ranges?**

Traditional C++ code often looks like this:

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << " ";
}
```

With **ranges**, you write more readable and safer code:

```cpp
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int x : vec | std::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; })) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
2 4
```

This prints only the even numbers — all done without managing iterators or creating temporary vectors.

---

## ✅ **What Problems Ranges Solve**

1. **Less Boilerplate** – No more manual loops or iterator code.
2. **Safe & Lazy Evaluation** – Uses **views**, which are *lightweight, non-owning*, and evaluated *only when needed*.
3. **Composable Operations** – Filter, transform, take, drop, etc., chained together.
4. **Improved Readability** – Clear intent, close to functional programming (like `map`, `filter` in Python).

---

## 💡 **More Examples**

### 1. **Filter + Transform (like map/filter)**

```cpp
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    auto evenSquares = nums 
        | std::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }) 
        | std::views::transform([](int n) { return n * n; });

    for (int x : evenSquares) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
}
```

**Output:** `4 16`

---

### 2. **Take First N Elements**

```cpp
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    for (int x : nums | std::views::take(3)) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
}
```

**Output:** `10 20 30`

## 🧠 When to Use Ranges

Use ranges when:

* You need **elegant data transformations**.
* You want to **avoid temporary containers**.
* You're tired of writing **manual loops**.
* You want **cleaner logic** for algorithms.

| Feature                 | Benefit                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `std::ranges`           | Unified way to work with collections |
| `std::views::filter`    | Filter elements                      |
| `std::views::transform` | Modify (map) elements                |
| Lazy evaluation         | No unnecessary computation           |
| Composability           | Chain operations easily              |

## 🧩 1. **What Are Ranges (Basic Explanation)?**

**Range** is a general term that means:

> "A sequence of elements you can iterate over using a loop."

In **C++20**, `std::ranges` is a library that improves how we work with these sequences.

### ✅ **Before C++20 (Without Ranges)**

You would write:

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4};

for (auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << " ";
}
```

You must manually use iterators, which can be verbose and error-prone.

---

## ✅ **With Ranges (C++20 and Later)**

C++20 introduces a **concept** called `std::ranges::range`.
This allows you to write code that treats anything iterable (like a vector, array, etc.) in a **standard and safer way**.

You can now write:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4};

    for (int value : vec) {  // vec is a range
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
}
```

This is a **range-based for loop**, which existed before C++20 — but now, ranges **have a formal definition and library support.**

---

## 🔍 So What Is a Range?

In C++20, a **range** is any object that supports:

* A `begin()` function that returns an iterator
* An `end()` function that returns a sentinel (usually another iterator)

### Example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30};
// v is a range because it has begin() and end()
```

The `std::ranges` library introduces **algorithms and views** that work with **any type that satisfies the "range" concept**.

---

## 🛠️ Ranges Without Views (`filter`, `transform`, etc.)

### You Can Use Ranges with Algorithms:

Instead of:

```cpp
std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
```

You can write (in C++20):

```cpp
std::ranges::sort(vec);
```

✅ This is:

* Safer (no need to write `begin()/end()`)
* Works with all kinds of containers and ranges
* Allows range checking automatically

## 🔄 Summary: Ranges Without Views

| Feature             | Traditional C++              | Ranges (C++20)                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Loop over container | `for (...)` with iterators   | `for (auto x : container)`          |
| Sort a container    | `std::sort(begin, end)`      | `std::ranges::sort(container)`      |
| Find an element     | `std::find(begin, end, val)` | `std::ranges::find(container, val)` |

You don’t need `filter`, `transform`, or `views` to use ranges — those are *advanced tools* for **lazy transformation** and **pipelining** (which we’ll discuss next).

---

## 🧠 Recap

* A **range** is anything you can iterate over.
* **C++20 Ranges** make it easier to write safe and readable code.
* You can use **algorithms like `std::ranges::sort`**, **range-based for loops**, and other features **without needing `filter` or `transform`.**
