Certainly! In C++, there are important "rules" related to special member functions that help manage resources safely and efficiently. These are often called:

### 1. Rule of Three
### 2. Rule of Five
### 3. Rule of Zero

## 1. Rule of Three

**When to use:**  
If your class manually manages resources (e.g., raw pointers with `new/delete`), you should explicitly define:

- Destructor (`~Class()`)
- Copy constructor (`Class(const Class&)`)
- Copy assignment operator (`Class& operator=(const Class&)`)

This prevents resource leaks, double frees, or shallow copies.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int* data;
public:
    MyClass(int value) : data(new int(value)) {}
    
    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() { delete data; }
    
    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : data(new int(*other.data)) {}
    
    // Copy assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

## 2. Rule of Five

**When to use:**  
With C++11 and later, if you define any of the above three, you should also define:

- Move constructor (`Class(Class&&) noexcept`)
- Move assignment operator (`Class& operator=(Class&&) noexcept`)

This improves performance by "stealing" resources from temporary objects rather than copying.

**Example (extends previous):**

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int* data;
public:
    MyClass(int value) : data(new int(value)) {}

    ~MyClass() { delete data; }

    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : data(new int(*other.data)) {}

    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move constructor
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr; // avoid double delete
    }

    // Move assignment
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

## 3. Rule of Zero

**What it is:**  
If possible, **avoid manually managing resources yourself**. Instead, use standard containers and RAII types (like smart pointers) that handle resource management automatically.

This way you **don't need to write destructors, copy/move constructors or assignment operators** yourself at all.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

class MyClass {
    // std::string manages its own memory
    std::string name;

    // smart pointer manages memory for you
    std::unique_ptr<int> data;

public:
    MyClass(std::string n, int val) : name(std::move(n)), data(std::make_unique<int>(val)) {}

    // Compiler-generated destructor, copy, move operators are OK here
};
```

### Summary Table

| Rule       | When to apply                               | Functions to write                         | Example usage                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Rule of 3  | Manually managing resource without move    | Destructor, copy ctor, copy assignment    | `new/delete` without smart pointers        |
| Rule of 5  | Same as Rule of 3, with move semantics     | + Move ctor, move assignment              | `new/delete` + optimize move operations    |
| Rule of 0  | Use RAII + standard containers/smart ptrs | None                                      | Use `std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::unique_ptr` |
