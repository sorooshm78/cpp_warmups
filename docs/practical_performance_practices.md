These two images illustrate how optimizing compilers can dramatically reduce complex high-level code into very simple machine instructions ‚Äî a testament to their sophistication.

---

### üìÑ **Image 1 Explanation: High-Level Code**

```cpp
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s("a");
    return s.size();
}
```

This C++ program:

* Includes the `<string>` header for using `std::string`.
* In `main()`, creates a string `s` with value `"a"`.
* Returns the size of the string, which is `1`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Image 2 Explanation: Optimized Assembly Output (g++ 5.1+)**

```asm
main:
    mov     eax, 1
    ret
```

This is the **entire assembly output** from compiling the code with optimization enabled (e.g., `-O2` or `-O3` with `g++ 5.1+`):

* `mov eax, 1`: The result (`1`) is directly loaded into the return register (`eax`).
* `ret`: Return from `main()`.

---

### ü§Ø Why This Is Amazing

The compiler realizes:

* `std::string s("a")` creates a known constant string `"a"`.
* `s.size()` is always `1`, and nothing in the program modifies `s`.
* Therefore, it **optimizes away all the string construction logic**, directly returning `1`.

The optimizer essentially says: ‚ÄúThis whole function will always return 1, so why bother doing all that work?‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Takeaway

This is a great example of **constant folding** and **dead code elimination**:

* The compiler does not even generate code to create the string.
* It only keeps the essential outcome.

That's why the slide is titled:

> **Optimizing Compilers Are Amazing**

Because they truly are.

Great observation ‚Äî and this is a subtle but fascinating point about **how compilers perform optimizations** in different contexts.

---

### üìÑ **Image 3 (High-Level Code)**

```cpp
#include <string>

int main()
{
    return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();
}
```

This code constructs two temporary strings `"a"` and `"b"`, calls `.size()` on each, and returns their sum ‚Äî which **logically is `1 + 1 = 2`**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Image 4 (Assembly Output)**

This time, the compiler **did not optimize** the result to a simple `return 2`. Instead, the output shows:

* A complex series of function calls and memory manipulations.
* Calls to `std::string` constructors.
* Safety checks and error handling logic (e.g. `std::__throw_logic_error`).

---

### ü§î **So Why Didn't the Compiler Just Return 2?**

Here‚Äôs why:

#### 1. **Temporary Objects & Side Effects**

Each `std::string("a")` and `std::string("b")` creates a **temporary object**. Although these constructors are trivial, the compiler may be conservative ‚Äî it assumes that:

* `std::string` construction might have side effects.
* `std::string::size()` might be virtual (it's not, but optimization phases can be cautious).

So it generates full construction and method-call code.

#### 2. **Separate String Instances**

Because there are **two separate string instances**, the compiler may not combine their `.size()` results at compile time unless it sees that both strings are constant and have no observable side effects.

#### 3. **Optimization Limitations**

Some compilers or optimization levels might **not perform inter-statement constant folding** when it involves temporary object construction ‚Äî unless **link-time optimization (LTO)** or more aggressive settings (like `-O3` + inlining + constexpr evaluation) are enabled.

---

### ‚úÖ When Would It Return `2`?

If you change the code to something more *obviously constexpr-friendly*, like:

```cpp
constexpr int f() {
    return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();
}
int main() {
    return f();
}
```

...or if you use **`constexpr` strings** with `std::string_view`, some compilers might optimize it fully.

---

### üîÅ Summary

| Scenario                                                    | Compiler Output                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `std::string s("a"); return s.size();`                      | `mov eax, 1` (fully optimized) |
| `return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();` | Full string construction logic |

üß† **Lesson**: Optimizing compilers are amazing ‚Äî but also cautious. If there's any chance of observable side effects, they err on the safe side unless optimization flags are pushed further or code is simplified.

This slide is from a C++ programming presentation and is addressing **efficient and correct use of virtual functions and destructors** in class hierarchies. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully.

---

### **Code Explanation**

```cpp
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() = default;
    virtual void do_a_thing() = 0;
};

struct Derived : Base {
    virtual ~Derived() = default;
    void do_a_thing() override {}
};
```

#### 1. `virtual ~Base() = default;`

* This is good practice.
* It **ensures proper cleanup** when a derived object is deleted through a `Base*` pointer.
* Marking it `= default` tells the compiler to generate the destructor automatically.

#### 2. `virtual void do_a_thing() = 0;`

* This is a **pure virtual function**.
* It makes `Base` an **abstract class**, so you cannot instantiate `Base` directly.
* Forces derived classes to implement `do_a_thing()`.

#### 3. `virtual ~Derived() = default;`

* This line is **what the slide critiques**.
* While not *incorrect*, it‚Äôs **redundant**.

---

## üß† Key Concepts Explained

### ‚úÖ Why `virtual ~Base()` is **necessary**

* If you ever write `Base* b = new Derived(); delete b;`, then `Derived`'s destructor must be called.
* If `~Base()` is **not virtual**, only `Base`'s destructor is invoked ‚Äî leading to **resource leaks or undefined behavior**.

---

### ‚ùå Why `virtual ~Derived()` is **unnecessary**

* Since `Base` already has a `virtual` destructor, **all derived destructors are automatically virtual**, whether or not you write `virtual` again.
* Writing `virtual` on `~Derived()` is **redundant** and adds noise without benefit.

---

### üß± "Move construction / assignment is disabled"

This refers to:

```cpp
virtual ~Base() = default;
```

* **Virtual destructors inhibit move semantics** unless **explicitly defaulted**.
* When a class has a virtual destructor, the compiler does **not implicitly generate** move constructors and move assignment operators.
* This is because adding a virtual table (`vtable`) pointer changes the semantics of moving objects (especially slicing concerns).

So:

```cpp
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() = default;
    Base(Base&&) = default;            // Add this if you want move constructor
    Base& operator=(Base&&) = default; // Add this if you want move assignment
};
```

---

### üìã Summary of What‚Äôs Wrong

1. **Unnecessary Work**: `virtual ~Derived()` repeats `virtual`, which is implied.
2. **Subtle Limitation**: Move constructor and assignment operator aren't generated unless manually defaulted in presence of virtual destructor.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice Version

```cpp
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() = default;
    virtual void do_a_thing() = 0;
    Base(Base&&) = default;
    Base& operator=(Base&&) = default;
};

struct Derived : Base {
    ~Derived() = default; // no need to repeat `virtual`
    void do_a_thing() override {}
};
```

This image is giving advice in the context of C++ smart pointers and object slicing: **"Don't Do More Work Than You Have To"**. It illustrates an inefficiency that can occur when passing smart pointers by value rather than by reference.

---

### üîç Let's break down the code:

```cpp
int use_a_base(std::shared_ptr<Base> p)
{
    return p->value();
}
```

* This function takes a `shared_ptr<Base>` **by value**.
* This **increments the reference count** of the shared pointer, which involves atomic operations and is **relatively expensive**.
* If the function just wants to **read** or **use** the object without taking ownership or modifying the pointer, this is unnecessary overhead.

---

```cpp
int main()
{
    auto ptr = std::make_shared<Derived>();
    use_a_base(ptr);
}
```

* `ptr` is a `shared_ptr<Derived>`, which gets **implicitly converted** to a `shared_ptr<Base>` when passed to `use_a_base`.
* This conversion involves **creating a new shared pointer**, which internally points to the same control block but still **bumps the ref count**.

---

### üí° The Better Way

To follow the advice "Don't Do More Work Than You Have To", you should **pass by `const&`** instead:

```cpp
int use_a_base(const std::shared_ptr<Base>& p)
{
    return p->value();
}
```

This way:

* You **avoid copying** the smart pointer.
* You **avoid incrementing/decrementing the reference count** unnecessarily.
* You **still ensure safety** because the function is not modifying the pointer.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Original Code             | Problem                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `std::shared_ptr<Base> p` | Copying increases ref count unnecessarily       |
| `use_a_base(ptr)`         | Causes extra work due to copy & type conversion |

**Solution:** Use `const std::shared_ptr<Base>& p` in the function parameter.
