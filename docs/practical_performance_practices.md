These two images illustrate how optimizing compilers can dramatically reduce complex high-level code into very simple machine instructions ‚Äî a testament to their sophistication.

### üìÑ **Image 1 Explanation: High-Level Code**

```cpp
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s("a");
    return s.size();
}
```

This C++ program:

* Includes the `<string>` header for using `std::string`.
* In `main()`, creates a string `s` with value `"a"`.
* Returns the size of the string, which is `1`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Image 2 Explanation: Optimized Assembly Output (g++ 5.1+)**

```asm
main:
    mov     eax, 1
    ret
```

This is the **entire assembly output** from compiling the code with optimization enabled (e.g., `-O2` or `-O3` with `g++ 5.1+`):

* `mov eax, 1`: The result (`1`) is directly loaded into the return register (`eax`).
* `ret`: Return from `main()`.

---

### ü§Ø Why This Is Amazing

The compiler realizes:

* `std::string s("a")` creates a known constant string `"a"`.
* `s.size()` is always `1`, and nothing in the program modifies `s`.
* Therefore, it **optimizes away all the string construction logic**, directly returning `1`.

The optimizer essentially says: ‚ÄúThis whole function will always return 1, so why bother doing all that work?‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Takeaway

This is a great example of **constant folding** and **dead code elimination**:

* The compiler does not even generate code to create the string.
* It only keeps the essential outcome.

That's why the slide is titled:

> **Optimizing Compilers Are Amazing**

Because they truly are.

Great observation ‚Äî and this is a subtle but fascinating point about **how compilers perform optimizations** in different contexts.

### üìÑ **Image 3 (High-Level Code)**

```cpp
#include <string>

int main()
{
    return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();
}
```

This code constructs two temporary strings `"a"` and `"b"`, calls `.size()` on each, and returns their sum ‚Äî which **logically is `1 + 1 = 2`**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Image 4 (Assembly Output)**

This time, the compiler **did not optimize** the result to a simple `return 2`. Instead, the output shows:

* A complex series of function calls and memory manipulations.
* Calls to `std::string` constructors.
* Safety checks and error handling logic (e.g. `std::__throw_logic_error`).

---

### ü§î **So Why Didn't the Compiler Just Return 2?**

Here‚Äôs why:

#### 1. **Temporary Objects & Side Effects**

Each `std::string("a")` and `std::string("b")` creates a **temporary object**. Although these constructors are trivial, the compiler may be conservative ‚Äî it assumes that:

* `std::string` construction might have side effects.
* `std::string::size()` might be virtual (it's not, but optimization phases can be cautious).

So it generates full construction and method-call code.

#### 2. **Separate String Instances**

Because there are **two separate string instances**, the compiler may not combine their `.size()` results at compile time unless it sees that both strings are constant and have no observable side effects.

#### 3. **Optimization Limitations**

Some compilers or optimization levels might **not perform inter-statement constant folding** when it involves temporary object construction ‚Äî unless **link-time optimization (LTO)** or more aggressive settings (like `-O3` + inlining + constexpr evaluation) are enabled.

---

### ‚úÖ When Would It Return `2`?

If you change the code to something more *obviously constexpr-friendly*, like:

```cpp
constexpr int f() {
    return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();
}
int main() {
    return f();
}
```

...or if you use **`constexpr` strings** with `std::string_view`, some compilers might optimize it fully.

---

### üîÅ Summary

| Scenario                                                    | Compiler Output                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `std::string s("a"); return s.size();`                      | `mov eax, 1` (fully optimized) |
| `return std::string("a").size() + std::string("b").size();` | Full string construction logic |

üß† **Lesson**: Optimizing compilers are amazing ‚Äî but also cautious. If there's any chance of observable side effects, they err on the safe side unless optimization flags are pushed further or code is simplified.
