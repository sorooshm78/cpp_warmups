In C++, both copy and move assignment operators typically return a reference to the current object (`*this`). This is why you often see declarations like:

```cpp
MyClass& MyClass::operator=(const MyClass& other); // Copy assignment
MyClass& MyClass::operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept; // Move assignment
```

Returning a reference (`MyClass&`) instead of a value (`MyClass`) is a standard practice for several important reasons:

### 1. **Assignment Chaining**

Returning a reference allows for assignment chaining, enabling expressions like:

```cpp
a = b = c;
```

Here's how it works:
- `b = c` is executed first, and since `operator=` returns a reference to `b`, the expression becomes `a = b`.
- Then, `a = b` is executed.

If `operator=` returned by value, each assignment would create a temporary object, which is less efficient and can lead to unexpected behavior.

### 2. **Efficiency**

Returning a reference avoids unnecessary copying of objects. If `operator=` were to return by value, it would involve:
- Creating a temporary object.
- Copying or moving the temporary object.

This not only adds overhead but can also complicate resource management, especially for classes that manage dynamic memory or other resources.

### 3. **Consistency with Built-in Types**

Built-in types in C++ (like `int`, `double`, etc.) allow chaining assignments because their assignment operators effectively behave as if they return a reference. By having user-defined types follow the same convention, you ensure consistency and predictability in how assignments work across different types.

### 4. **Avoiding Slicing**

When dealing with inheritance, returning by reference helps prevent object slicing, where parts of a derived object might be "sliced off" if a base class object is returned by value.

### 5. **Conventional Practice**

Following the conventional signature for assignment operators (`MyClass& operator=`) ensures that your class behaves correctly with various language features and libraries that expect this signature. It also makes your code more readable and understandable to other developers who are familiar with C++ conventions.

### Example Implementation

Here's how you might typically implement copy and move assignment operators:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Copy assignment
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            // Copy resources from other to this
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move assignment
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            // Move resources from other to this
            // Leave other in a valid state
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

### Summary

Returning a reference from copy and move assignment operators in C++:

- Enables assignment chaining.
- Improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary copies.
- Ensures consistency with built-in types and standard C++ conventions.
- Prevents object slicing in inheritance hierarchies.

By adhering to this practice, you ensure that your classes behave intuitively and perform efficiently within the C++ language framework.
