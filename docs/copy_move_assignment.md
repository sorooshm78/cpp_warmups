In C++, both copy and move assignment operators typically return a reference to the current object (`*this`). This is why you often see declarations like:

```cpp
MyClass& MyClass::operator=(const MyClass& other); // Copy assignment
MyClass& MyClass::operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept; // Move assignment
```

Returning a reference (`MyClass&`) instead of a value (`MyClass`) is a standard practice for several important reasons:

### 1. **Assignment Chaining**

Returning a reference allows for assignment chaining, enabling expressions like:

```cpp
a = b = c;
```

Here's how it works:
- `b = c` is executed first, and since `operator=` returns a reference to `b`, the expression becomes `a = b`.
- Then, `a = b` is executed.

If `operator=` returned by value, each assignment would create a temporary object, which is less efficient and can lead to unexpected behavior.

### 2. **Efficiency**

Returning a reference avoids unnecessary copying of objects. If `operator=` were to return by value, it would involve:
- Creating a temporary object.
- Copying or moving the temporary object.

This not only adds overhead but can also complicate resource management, especially for classes that manage dynamic memory or other resources.

### 3. **Consistency with Built-in Types**

Built-in types in C++ (like `int`, `double`, etc.) allow chaining assignments because their assignment operators effectively behave as if they return a reference. By having user-defined types follow the same convention, you ensure consistency and predictability in how assignments work across different types.

### 4. **Avoiding Slicing**

When dealing with inheritance, returning by reference helps prevent object slicing, where parts of a derived object might be "sliced off" if a base class object is returned by value.

### 5. **Conventional Practice**

Following the conventional signature for assignment operators (`MyClass& operator=`) ensures that your class behaves correctly with various language features and libraries that expect this signature. It also makes your code more readable and understandable to other developers who are familiar with C++ conventions.

### Example Implementation

Here's how you might typically implement copy and move assignment operators:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Copy assignment
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            // Copy resources from other to this
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move assignment
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            // Move resources from other to this
            // Leave other in a valid state
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

### Summary

Returning a reference from copy and move assignment operators in C++:

- Enables assignment chaining.
- Improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary copies.
- Ensures consistency with built-in types and standard C++ conventions.
- Prevents object slicing in inheritance hierarchies.

By adhering to this practice, you ensure that your classes behave intuitively and perform efficiently within the C++ language framework.

Understood that the previous explanations were not clear enough. Let’s revisit the topic with more detailed explanations.

### Your Expression:

```cpp
ptr2 = std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr);
```

In this expression, you have three pointers (or objects): `ptr`, `ptr1`, and `ptr2`. The goal of this code is to transfer resources (resources management) from `ptr` to `ptr1`, and then from `ptr1` to `ptr2`. However, you’ve noticed that instead of **move assignment**, a **copy assignment** is being invoked. Let’s explore why this happens.

### How the Expression is Evaluated:

1. **First, the Inner Operation is Executed:**
   ```cpp
   std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr);
   ```
   This part first moves `ptr` into `ptr1`. If everything is set up correctly, this should invoke a **move assignment**.

2. **Then, the Result is Assigned to `ptr2`:**
   ```cpp
   ptr2 = (result of the previous step);
   ```

### Why a **Copy Assignment** Might Be Called:

The main issue lies in how the `operator=` is implemented for your class. Let’s examine two scenarios:

#### 1. **Returning a Reference (`return *this;`):**

If the `operator=` correctly returns a reference to the object itself, then the chaining of assignments works properly, and **move assignment** is invoked as expected.

**Example:**

```cpp
struct MyPointer {
    MyPointer& operator=(MyPointer&& other) {
        // Move resources from other to this object
        return *this; // Return a reference to this object
    }

    // If a copy assignment operator is defined:
    MyPointer& operator=(const MyPointer& other) {
        // Copy resources from other to this object
        return *this;
    }
};

MyPointer ptr, ptr1, ptr2;
ptr2 = std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr); // Both assignments are move assignments
```

In this case:
- `std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr)` returns a reference to `ptr1`.
- Then, `ptr2 = ptr1` is executed, which performs a **move assignment**.

#### 2. **Returning by Value (`return *this;` as a Value):**

If the `operator=` returns a copy of the object instead of a reference, the result of `std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr)` becomes a temporary object. Consequently, when you assign this temporary object to `ptr2`, a **copy assignment** is invoked instead of a **move assignment**.

**Incorrect Example:**

```cpp
struct MyPointer {
    MyPointer operator=(MyPointer&& other) { // Returns by value
        // Move resources from other to this object
        return *this; // Returns a copy
    }
};

MyPointer ptr, ptr1, ptr2;
ptr2 = std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr); // First move assignment, then copy assignment
```

In this scenario:
- `std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr)` returns a temporary `MyPointer` object.
- Then, `ptr2 = (temporary object)` invokes the **copy assignment** because it's assigning from a temporary (which behaves like an rvalue but is treated as an lvalue in this context).

### How to Check and Fix the Issue:

1. **Verify the `operator=` Implementation:**
   Ensure that your move assignment operator returns a reference to the object (`*this`) rather than returning by value.

   **Correct Implementation:**
   ```cpp
   struct MyPointer {
       MyPointer& operator=(MyPointer&& other) {
           if (this != &other) {
               // Release current resources
               // Transfer resources from other to this object
           }
           return *this; // Return a reference to this object
       }
   };
   ```

   **Incorrect Implementation:**
   ```cpp
   struct MyPointer {
       MyPointer operator=(MyPointer&& other) { // Returns by value
           if (this != &other) {
               // Release current resources
               // Transfer resources from other to this object
           }
           return *this; // Returns a copy
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Use Debugging Tools:**
   Utilize debugging tools like `gdb` or `clang` to inspect which version of `operator=` is being called.

3. **Proper Use of `= default` or `= delete`:**
   If you’re using standard classes like `std::unique_ptr`, ensure that move semantics are correctly implemented and that the move assignment operators are properly defined.

### Summary:

A **copy assignment** is being called in the expression `ptr2 = std::move(ptr1) = std::move(ptr);` because the `operator=` is returning a temporary object by value instead of returning a reference to the object itself. This leads the outer assignment (`ptr2 = ...`) to perform a copy rather than a move.

**To resolve this issue:**

- **Ensure that the `operator=` for move assignment returns a reference to the object (`MyPointer&`).**
- **Confirm that your class correctly implements move semantics, transferring resources safely and efficiently.**
