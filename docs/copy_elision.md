Sure! Let’s dive a bit deeper into **Copy Elision** and how it relates to **RVO** and the C++ standards.

## Copy Elision and RVO Explained

### Copy Elision

**Copy elision** is the general term for the compiler optimization where copy or move constructors are **omitted**, even if they have side effects.

This means the compiler can skip creating temporary objects and directly construct the object in its final location.

### Return Value Optimization (RVO)

RVO is a **specific kind** of copy elision that happens **when returning objects from a function**.

- The compiler constructs the return value directly in the caller’s space.
- So, no copy or move constructor is called for the returned object.

## How the C++ Standard Treats Copy Elision

- **Before C++17**, copy elision was an optional optimization. The compiler was *allowed* but *not required* to elide copies or moves.
- **Since C++17**, copy elision in some cases, including RVO, is **mandatory**.

This means:

- In C++17 and later, when you write code like:

  ```cpp
  Moo foo() {
      Moo moo{"hello"};
      return moo;
  }
  ```

  The compiler **must** construct the returned `Moo` object directly in the caller’s storage.
  
- The copy or move constructor is **not called at all**, even if they have side effects.

## What about `std::move` and Copy Elision?

- If you write `return std::move(moo);`, you **explicitly request a move**.
- But since copy elision is mandatory (and better), it’s almost always **better to omit `std::move`** and write `return moo;`.
- Explicitly moving in return statements may **disable copy elision** in some cases, forcing a move operation that is slower than elision.

## Summary

| Concept                | Before C++17                        | Since C++17                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Copy elision on return  | Optional (compiler decides)        | Mandatory in many cases           |
| Returning by value      | May call copy/move constructors    | Must elide copy/move, construct in-place |
| `return std::move(x);` | Forces move, may disable elision   | Same but generally unnecessary    |
