In CMake, the `target_link_libraries()` function allows you to specify the dependencies between libraries or targets. The key idea behind linking types (`PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, and `INTERFACE`) is to define how the dependencies (such as libraries or headers) affect other targets that depend on your target.

Here's a simple breakdown of each linking type with examples:

### 1. **PUBLIC**
- **Meaning:** When you link a library with `PUBLIC`, you're saying that the linked library is required for both the implementation **and** the public API of your target. In other words, if another target depends on your target, they also need the linked library.
  
- **Example:**
    ```cmake
    add_library(A ...)
    add_library(B ...)

    target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC B)  # A uses B both internally and in its public API
    ```

    - `target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC B)` means:
        - A needs B to work (internally).
        - Any target that links A will also need to know about B because A exposes B in its public API.
  
    If another target `C` links `A`, then it will automatically get access to `B`.

    ```cmake
    add_library(C ...)
    target_link_libraries(C PUBLIC A)  # C links A, and now C can also use B because A exposes B.
    ```

### 2. **PRIVATE**
- **Meaning:** When you link a library with `PRIVATE`, you're saying that the linked library is only needed for the **implementation** of your target, not for the public API. Targets that depend on your target donâ€™t need to know about the private library.
  
- **Example:**
    ```cmake
    add_library(A ...)
    add_library(B ...)

    target_link_libraries(A PRIVATE B)  # A uses B internally, but not in its public API
    ```

    - `target_link_libraries(A PRIVATE B)` means:
        - A needs B to work, but B is not exposed to targets that depend on A.

    ```cmake
    add_library(C ...)
    target_link_libraries(C PRIVATE A)  # C links A, but C doesn't need to know about B
    ```

    In this case, `C` can use `A`, but it does **not** need to know about `B`, because `B` is only needed by `A` internally.

### 3. **INTERFACE**
- **Meaning:** An `INTERFACE` library is typically used for header-only libraries. These libraries do not have any compiled implementation (i.e., no `.cpp` files). The target is used to provide include directories or other properties that other targets can use, but it does not produce any binary.
  
- **Example:**
    ```cmake
    add_library(D INTERFACE)  # D is an INTERFACE library
    target_include_directories(D INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
    ```

    - `target_include_directories(D INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)` means:
        - Target `D` provides headers (and possibly other properties like compiler flags) for other targets that link to it.
        - `D` doesn't compile anything on its own.

    If another target `E` links `D`, it will automatically have access to the include directories specified in `D`.

    ```cmake
    add_library(E ...)
    target_link_libraries(E INTERFACE D)  # E can now use the headers from D
    ```

    `D` is just a collection of headers or properties (like `target_include_directories()`) that are propagated to other targets linking to it.

---

### Summary:
- **PUBLIC**: A target uses the library both in its implementation **and** in its public API. Targets that depend on this target also need to link to the library.
- **PRIVATE**: A target uses the library only in its implementation, and other targets that depend on it don't need to know about this library.
- **INTERFACE**: The library doesn't have any implementation; it provides only properties (like headers or compiler flags) for other targets to use.
