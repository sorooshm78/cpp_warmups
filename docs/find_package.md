### `find_package` and `execute_process` in CMake

In CMake, `find_package` and `execute_process` are commands used to handle external dependencies, configuration, and process execution within your build system. Both play important roles in automating tasks and integrating with external tools, libraries, or software. Below is a detailed explanation of each command, with examples and use cases.

### `find_package` Command

#### What is `find_package`?

`find_package` is used in CMake to locate and configure external libraries or packages that your project depends on. It can search for the package in various directories, check for its existence, and set necessary variables that allow you to link and use that package in your project.

#### Why is it needed?

When you're building a project that relies on external dependencies (like libraries or frameworks), `find_package` automates the process of searching for and configuring these dependencies, saving you from manually specifying paths or settings. It ensures your project is portable and can be built on different machines without needing to manually configure each library's path.

#### What problem does it solve?

- **Locating dependencies**: It eliminates the need for hardcoding paths to libraries.
- **Cross-platform builds**: Helps to configure external dependencies on different systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) without manually adjusting paths or settings.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that dependencies are correctly found and configured, avoiding issues that may arise from manually managing libraries.

#### Example of `find_package`

Imagine you're building a C++ project that requires the **Boost** library. Here’s how you could use `find_package` to automatically find and link the Boost library.

1. **Basic `CMakeLists.txt` with `find_package`**:

```cmake
# Specify the minimum version of CMake required
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Define your project
project(MyProject)

# Find Boost package (with version 1.70 or higher)
find_package(Boost 1.70 REQUIRED)

# If Boost is found, you can link it to your project
add_executable(my_project main.cpp)

# Link Boost libraries to your target
target_link_libraries(my_project Boost::Boost)
```

2. **Explanation**:

   - `find_package(Boost 1.70 REQUIRED)`: This tells CMake to look for Boost version 1.70 or higher. If it can't find it, the `REQUIRED` flag will cause CMake to stop with an error.
   - `target_link_libraries(my_project Boost::Boost)`: This links the Boost libraries to your project, ensuring you can use Boost's functionalities in your code.

3. **Output**:

   - If Boost is found, CMake configures the project, sets necessary variables, and links the Boost library with your project.
   - If Boost is not found, CMake will terminate with an error message, indicating that Boost is a required dependency.

### `execute_process` Command

#### What is `execute_process`?

`execute_process` is used in CMake to run external processes (like shell commands or scripts) during the configuration phase of the build process. This allows you to invoke tools, fetch data, or perform setup steps outside of CMake’s native functionality.

#### Why is it needed?

You might need to run external processes for tasks that aren’t directly supported by CMake’s built-in commands. For example, you may need to:
- Run a custom script.
- Check system configurations.
- Fetch the current version of a tool or library.
- Execute a tool that generates files (like code generation tools).

#### What problem does it solve?

- **Automating external tasks**: You can automate tasks such as running pre-build scripts, checking versions of external tools, or even generating source files.
- **Process integration**: It allows you to integrate external tools into your build system that may not have a native CMake module.
- **Custom logic**: It provides flexibility to execute custom commands or actions before or after the build.

---

#### Example of `execute_process`

Let’s imagine you want to check if a specific version of a tool (e.g., `git`) is installed on the system and capture its version number. Here’s how you can use `execute_process` for that:

1. **Basic `CMakeLists.txt` with `execute_process`**:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(MyProject)

# Check for the installed version of git
execute_process(
    COMMAND git --version
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE GIT_VERSION
    ERROR_VARIABLE GIT_ERROR
    RESULT_VARIABLE GIT_RESULT
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE
)

# If git is not installed, print an error message
if(NOT GIT_RESULT EQUAL 0)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Git is not installed or the version check failed!")
else()
    message(STATUS "Git version: ${GIT_VERSION}")
endif()

# Add your executable
add_executable(my_project main.cpp)
```

2. **Explanation**:

   - `execute_process(COMMAND git --version ...)`: This runs the `git --version` command to retrieve the installed version of `git`.
   - `OUTPUT_VARIABLE GIT_VERSION`: Captures the standard output (the version string) of the command.
   - `ERROR_VARIABLE GIT_ERROR`: Captures any error output from the command.
   - `RESULT_VARIABLE GIT_RESULT`: Captures the result of the process. If the command runs successfully, it will be `0`; otherwise, it will be non-zero.
   - `OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE`: Strips any trailing whitespace from the output, which is often present in command output like version strings.

3. **Output**:

   - If Git is installed and the command succeeds, CMake will print the version of Git.
   - If Git is not installed or the version check fails, CMake will stop and print an error message: "Git is not installed or the version check failed!"

### When to Use `find_package` vs `execute_process`

#### Use `find_package` when:
- You are looking for libraries, tools, or packages that have CMake support (either via official modules or custom CMake files).
- You want to integrate well-known packages (like Boost, OpenSSL, or Qt) into your project.
- You need CMake to automatically manage the configuration of external dependencies for cross-platform builds.

#### Use `execute_process` when:
- You need to run arbitrary shell commands or external programs that aren't directly available via CMake modules.
- You need to perform some setup or configuration task, like checking system status, generating files, or processing data.
- You need custom logic in your build system (e.g., checking for tool versions, reading system environment variables, etc.).

---

### Summary

- **`find_package`**: Automates the process of finding external libraries and tools. It is ideal for integrating well-known dependencies into your project. It solves the problem of managing external libraries, ensuring they are correctly located and configured.
  
- **`execute_process`**: Executes external processes or commands within the CMake configuration step. It’s useful when you need to run custom scripts or check the status of tools, solve system-specific issues, or integrate with external processes.

Both commands are essential tools in CMake that help you automate and manage external dependencies, configurations, and system checks, making it easier to build complex projects with external components or tools.
