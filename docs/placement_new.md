### What is **placement new** in C++?

**Placement new** is a special version of the `new` operator in C++ that constructs an object in a pre-allocated memory buffer. It allows you to separate memory allocation from object construction.

---

### Syntax

```cpp
new (pointer) Type(args);
```

Here:

* `pointer` is a memory location already allocated (like from `malloc`, stack buffer, or custom allocator).
* `Type` is the type of the object you want to construct.
* `args` are the constructor arguments.

---

### Why Use Placement New?

* **Custom memory management**: Useful in embedded systems or performance-critical applications.
* **Avoid frequent allocations**: E.g., using memory pools.
* **Construct objects in pre-allocated buffers**: For controlling memory layout or in-place object replacement.

---

### Example: Basic Usage of Placement New

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <new>     // For std::nothrow

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int x) : value(x) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called with value: " << value << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructor called for value: " << value << std::endl;
    }
private:
    int value;
};

int main() {
    // Step 1: Allocate raw memory (enough to hold MyClass)
    char buffer[sizeof(MyClass)];

    // Step 2: Use placement new to construct object in buffer
    MyClass* obj = new (buffer) MyClass(42);

    // Use the object
    // ...

    // Step 3: Manually call the destructor
    obj->~MyClass();

    // No need to free buffer, since it was stack allocated
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Key Points

1. **No memory allocation** is done by placement `new`; memory is assumed to already exist.
2. You **must manually call the destructor** if you use placement new.
3. Don't use `delete` on objects created with placement new â€” it only applies to regular `new`.

---

### When Not to Use Placement New

* If you donâ€™t need fine-grained memory control, prefer standard `new/delete`.
* Misuse can lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior if you forget destructor calls or overwrite un-destroyed objects.

## ðŸ”¹ What is "placement new" in C++?

In C++, the `new` operator is normally used to:

1. Allocate memory.
2. Call the constructor of the object in that memory.

### Example:

```cpp
MyClass* obj = new MyClass(); // allocates memory + calls constructor
```

However, **placement new** allows you to **construct an object in a pre-allocated memory buffer**. This means **you handle memory allocation manually**, and then call the constructor using **placement new**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax of Placement New

```cpp
void* buffer = malloc(sizeof(MyClass));      // Step 1: allocate memory manually
MyClass* obj = new(buffer) MyClass();        // Step 2: placement new (construct object)
```

Notice this part:

```cpp
new(buffer) MyClass()
```

It means: construct a `MyClass` object at the memory address pointed to by `buffer`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why use placement new?

You might need **placement new** in cases such as:

1. **Custom memory management**
   For example, in performance-critical systems (games, embedded systems), you might allocate a memory pool and construct objects in that pre-allocated memory.

2. **Avoiding repeated allocations**
   You want to allocate a block of memory once and construct objects in-place to reduce fragmentation and overhead.

3. **Constructing at a specific address**
   Sometimes you need to place an object at a specific memory address (e.g., in a shared memory segment, hardware-mapped address, etc.)

4. **Object pools / arena allocators**
   You may reuse memory many times for different objects â€” placement new constructs an object in a reused memory block.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Using placement new

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for malloc, free

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int x) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called with x = " << x << std::endl;
        this->x = x;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructor called for x = " << x << std::endl;
    }
private:
    int x;
};

int main() {
    // Allocate raw memory
    void* memory = malloc(sizeof(MyClass));

    // Use placement new to construct object
    MyClass* obj = new(memory) MyClass(42);

    // Manually call destructor
    obj->~MyClass();

    // Free raw memory
    free(memory);

    return 0;
}
```

### Output:

```
Constructor called with x = 42
Destructor called for x = 42
```

## ðŸ”¹ What problem does placement new solve?

It gives you **fine-grained control** over **object lifetime** and **memory allocation**, allowing:

* Pre-allocation for speed and determinism.
* Avoiding heap allocations (important in embedded systems).
* Using shared memory or memory-mapped files.
* Implementing allocators or custom containers efficiently.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Caution!

* If you use placement new, **you are responsible for calling the destructor manually**.
* Mixing placement new and normal `delete` is **undefined behavior**.
* You must ensure the buffer is properly aligned for the object you're constructing.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary Table

| Aspect            | Regular `new`          | Placement `new`            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Memory allocation | Yes                    | No (you allocate manually) |
| Calls constructor | Yes                    | Yes                        |
| Calls destructor  | With `delete`          | You must call manually     |
| Use case          | Simple heap allocation | Custom memory management   |
| Syntax            | `new MyClass()`        | `new(ptr) MyClass()`       |
