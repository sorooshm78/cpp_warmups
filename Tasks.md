# Todo
* [X] return value of copy/move assigment with test
* [ ] self assigment logic with test
* [ ] first two lines of move assigment
* [ ] noexcept and explicit implement
* [ ] google test different classes int string user-define-type
* [ ] weak_ptr with rational example
* [ ] thread safty class and implement and write test for show this 
* [ ] behavior copy and move constructor
* [X] class method right const
* [X] mutable keyword with example
* [X] explicit keyword
* [X] noexcept keyword
* [X] why const is needed function input varibles with test
