* [X] class method right const
* [X] mutable keyword with example
* [ ] first two lines of move assigment 
* [X] explicit keyword 
* [X] noexcept keyword 
* [ ] noexcept and explicit implement
* [ ] google test different classes int string user-define-type 
* [ ] return value of copy/move assigment with test
